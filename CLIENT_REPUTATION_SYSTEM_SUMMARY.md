## Technical Implementation Details

### Two-Way Review System Logic

**1. Review Submission Flow:**
```
Client completes project → Developer submits review → Review saved (hidden)
Developer review → Client submits review → Database trigger fires
Trigger → Sets is_mutual_visible = true for both reviews
Both reviews → Now publicly visible
Client reputation stats → Automatically updated
```

**2. Eligibility Requirements:**
- ✅ Project status = "completed"
- ✅ Payment status = "paid"
- ✅ User is part of project
- ✅ User hasn't already reviewed
- ❌ Fail any = cannot review

**3. Visibility Rules:**
- Private: `is_mutual_visible = false` (only parties involved can see)
- Public: `is_mutual_visible = true` (everyone can see)
- Aggregated ratings always visible

### Reputation Calculation

```typescript
// Overall rating formula
average_rating = (
  AVG(rating_communication) +
  AVG(rating_professionalism) +
  AVG(rating_project_clarity) +
  AVG(rating_payment_timeliness)
) / 4

// Star distribution
5-star: round(avg) === 5
4-star: round(avg) === 4
// etc.

// Repeat hire rate
repeat_hire_rate = (
  (total_hires - unique_developers) / total_hires
) * 100
```

### Security Implementation

**Row Level Security Policies:**
- Client profiles: Public read, owner edit only
- Project reviews: Visible if mutual OR if user involved
- Project hires: Visible to client and developer only

**Storage Security:**
- Company logos: Public bucket for read access
- Upload: Restricted to user's own folder
- Path format: `company-logos/{user_id}/logo.{ext}`
- File validation: Max 2MB, allowed types enforced

**Data Privacy:**
- Aggregated data (averages, counts): Always public
- Review details: Private until mutual
- Personal information: Protected by RLS

### Performance Optimizations

**Database Indexes (12 total):**
- User ID lookups: `idx_client_profiles_user_id`
- Rating queries: `idx_client_profiles_average_rating`
- Review queries: `idx_reviews_reviewee`, `idx_reviews_project`
- Hire queries: `idx_hires_client`, `idx_hires_developer`
- Composite indexes for complex queries

**Automated Triggers:**
- Mutual visibility: Automatic when both reviews submitted
- Reputation stats: Auto-updated on new reviews
- No manual intervention required

**React Optimizations:**
- Context provider for global state
- useCallback for stable function references
- Conditional data loading
- Error boundaries recommended

## Business Impact

### Developer Retention
- **Trust Building**: Developers can verify client reputation before accepting projects
- **Accountability**: Clients must maintain professional behavior to attract talent
- **Transparency**: Public ratings create marketplace trust

### Quality Control

// Wrap app
<ClientProvider>
  <App />
</ClientProvider>
```
